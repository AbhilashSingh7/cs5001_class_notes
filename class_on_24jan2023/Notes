WEEK 3

Strings

    Use input to get user input
        in_string = input("Please enter a string: ")
        print(f"Your string is \"{in_string}\"")
        print(f"Your string is {len(in_string)} characters long.")
        cap_in_string = in_string.upper()
        print(cap_in_string)

            len: finds the lenght of the string. In-built
            .upper: Changes to ALL CAPS
            .lower: Change to lower case

            It doesnt actually change the script, it just shows one version of it. Original remains the same

    Index

        Index starts with 0. Gives the letter in the string at that index. 

        print(in_string[0])
        print(in_string[1])
        print(in_string[2])
        print(in_string[3])
        print(in_string[4])
        print(in_string[5])

        print(in_string[len(in_string)-1]) = To get the last one
        short cut for the one above print(in_string[-1])
        print(in_string[2:8]) = Would print everything between 2nd and 7th(remember index is -1)
        print(in_string[-1::-1]) = will print it in reverse
        print(in_string[::]) = will print it out as it is

        print(f"The first instance of 'll' appears at position {in_string.find('ll')}") = Finds where ll is in the string
        print(f"The first instance of 'll' appears at position {in_string.rfind('ll')}") = rfind finds it from the right
        result is -1 if it doesnt find anything

     Name exercise:

        fullname = input("Input your full name:")

        name_break = fullname.rfind(' ')

        first_and_middle = fullname[:name_break]
l       ast = fullname[name_break+1:]


        print("Your name in last-name first format:")

        print(f"{last}, {first_and_middle}")
