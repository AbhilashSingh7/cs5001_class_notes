WEEK 3

Strings

    Use input to get user input
        in_string = input("Please enter a string: ")
        print(f"Your string is \"{in_string}\"")
        print(f"Your string is {len(in_string)} characters long.")
        cap_in_string = in_string.upper()
        print(cap_in_string)

    len: finds the lenght of the string. In-built
    .upper: Changes to ALL CAPS
    .lower: Change to lower case

    It doesnt actually change the script, it just shows one version of it. Original remains the same
